# Two Sum Solution (C++)

This program efficiently solves the "Two Sum" problem: given an array of integers and a target integer, it returns the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

**Algorithm:** Utilizes a hash map (std::map) for O(n) time complexity, storing complements and their indices for quick lookup.

**Compilation:**
